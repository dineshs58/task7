                <h4>Earning the right</h4>
                <p>As a first order business consulting firm, we help companies, foundations and individuals make a difference. Our work gets to the heart of the matter. We break silos because it takes more than any one check or policy or letter to tackle big issues like economic security, human rights or climate sustainability. We prescribe a custom formula of advocacy, collaboration, investment, philanthropy, policy and new ways of doing business in order to help you make progress.</p>
